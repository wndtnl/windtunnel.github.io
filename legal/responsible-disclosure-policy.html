        <div class="legal__header--h1">Responsible Disclosure Policy</div>

        <p><em>In effect since: 1 May 2020</em></p>

        <div class="legal__header--h2">Introduction</div>

        <p>
            WindTunnel Technologies designs, builds and distributes its digital services and products in line with
            industry best practices,
            and maintains the highest standards regarding security and data protection.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite our efforts and best intentions, we acknowledge vulnerabilities might slip through internal testing
            and make it to production unnoticed.
            We therefore opt for a policy of coordinated disclosure, as to provide well-intended third parties a
            transparent and formal procedure to share
            any vulnerability related information.
        </p>

        <p>
            This policy applies to all software directly created and maintained by WindTunnel Technologies.
            In case of doubt, please contact us at <a href="mailto:security@windtunnel.io">security@windtunnel.io</a>.
        </p>

        <div class="legal__header--h2">Reporting a Vulnerability</div>

        <p>
            If you believe to have discovered a vulnerability in one of our services or products, we ask you to:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Report the vulnerability as soon as possible after discovery.
                Mail your findings to <a href="mailto:security@windtunnel.io">security@windtunnel.io</a> and encrypt the
                mail
                using our <a href="windtunnel_pgp_pubkey.txt">PGP key</a> to prevent the information from falling into
                the wrong hands.
                In case your are not able to use PGP encryption, <u>do not include any vulnerability details in your
                initial mail</u>. We will offer you a secure channel
                to share your findings as part of our reply.
            </li>
            <li>
                If possible, help us to quickly and accurately triage the vulnerability by providing a benign proof of
                exploitation.
                Allow us to reproduce your findings by providing sufficiently detailed instructions and/or sample data.
                Include the name of the service or product, and the version number where applicable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Ensure we can contact you should we have additional questions. Leave your contact details, such as name,
                e-mail address and/or telephone number.
                You have the right to stay anonymous, so reporting under a pseudonym is possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Confirm that you have acted, and will continue to act in accordance with this policy.
            </li>
        </ul>
