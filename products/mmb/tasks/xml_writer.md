# XML Writer

- [General](/tasks/xml_writer?id=general)
- [Examples](/tasks/xml_writer?id=examples)

## General

The *XML Writer* task allows updating one or more field values in one or more XML-based files.
Fields are selected using [XPath](https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath-3/) expressions.
Both path expressions and field values can use any [Bamboo variable](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bamboo/bamboo-variables-289277087.html) defined at the point of execution.

> Except for the usage of XPath expressions for the field path instead of JSONPath, the XML Writer task is identical to the JSON Writer task.
> Please consult the [JSON Writer](/tasks/json_writer.md) documentation for an in-depth discussion.

## Examples

Please refer to the [XML Reader Examples](/tasks/xml_reader?id=examples).
