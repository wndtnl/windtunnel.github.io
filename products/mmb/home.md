[Android Manifest](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro), [.NET Nuspec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec),
[Apple Plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/AboutInformationPropertyListFiles.html)...
- YAML field values using [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath), such as: [Kubernetes Specs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/),
[Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/), [Dart & Flutter pubspec](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec)...
